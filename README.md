# Requirements and Dependencies
Python Libraries: The code relies on fundamental Python libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, keras, and tensorflow.

Execution Environment: Google Colab serves as the preferred environment due to its compatibility with Google Drive for data access.

#Journey Through the Code

#Data Exploration and Preparation:
The code commences with loading and preprocessing the customer churn dataset fetched from Google Drive.
Initial steps involve removing unnecessary columns, handling missing data, and encoding categorical features for model readiness.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
You'll find visualizations like boxplots and count plots that help in understanding data distributions and relationships between variables.

#Feature Engineering:
The code scales the dataset features using StandardScaler and employs a Random Forest Classifier for feature selection.

#Neural Network Model Building:
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is constructed using the Keras Functional API, aiming to predict customer churn accurately.

#Hyperparameter Tuning and Evaluation:
GridSearchCV was used for finding optimal hyperparameters, enhancing the model's performance. Metrics like accuracy and AUC are used for model evaluation.

#Model Retraining and Evaluation:
The best model identified through hyperparameter tuning is retrained using the most effective parameters. It's then evaluated on test and validation datasets to gauge its performance.

#Model Deployment Preparation:
A trained and validated model (deployment.h5) along with the scaler used (my_scalar.pkl) are used for deployment.

Instructions for Use
Environment Setup: Ensure the necessary Python libraries are installed, and you can use a Jupyter environment, or preferably Google Colab.
